Plex downloader

This is a simple downloader for movies and tv shows of accessible plex media servers. 
Focused on proper functioning rather than good looking design. Features:
- .Net backend + React frontend 
- Log in by plex.tv, no need for typing in password into this app
- Sync all media metadata of all accessible servers, backed by local db
- Browse all media, select and download directly
- docker support (yet untested)

Until now it downloads stuff into MyVideos - will be changed to configurable download directory soon.
